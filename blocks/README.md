# Blocks
A smple [Arduboy](https://www.arduboy.com) game.

# Description
Move boxes around until they're where they belong.

## Some notes about Blocks

- The current level you are on is saved if you power-cycle the game. (The 
level is stored in EEPROM.)
- You can always reset the level you're on, and you can also exit the game.
- Now with 31 levels of varying difficulty.

## Game level editor

The game level editor is now included in the "levels" directory. You don't 
need this if you wish to run the Arduboy game, but it helps if you wish to
build new levels. The source was built with Eclipse, and I've included the
Eclipse project files.

The game editor contains a panel which shows the code that needs to be cut
and pasted into the source code. You can also validate each level using the
"Test" button, which will recursively exhaust all possible moves until it
determines if the level can be played to conclusion correctly or not. (Note
that if you have more than 2 boxes, the search can take a long time.)

Because sometimes I miss the old days when I did embedded software development. :-)
